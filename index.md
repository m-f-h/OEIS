Programs and interactive illustrations for OEIS sequences.

The main interest of these github.io pages is to make web pages with JS 
(and maybe one day streamlit web applications) for interactive illustrations available from everywhere.

Interactive illustrations:
- [A000124-interactive.html](A000124-interactive.html)
- [A006561-interactive-V3.html](A006561-interactive-V3.html)
- [A285357-interactive.html](A285357-interactive.html)
- [A298636-interactive.html](A298636-interactive.html)
- [A319018-A322050-interactive.html](A319018-A322050-interactive.html)
- [A377091-interactive.html](A377091-interactive.html)

Other content, in part originally created as .txt or .md file and/or later (re)designed as github page, 
but also the .gp and .py files with programs but usually also lots of comments, calculations etc.,
is now progressively [moved to my github OEIS wiki: SEE THERE!](https://github.com/m-f-h/OEIS/wiki)

Technical notes to myself:
- ["TO DO list" (page)](TODO.html) [(in the repo)](https://github.com/m-f-h/OEIS/)
- [pense-bête pages github](pense-bête%20pages%20github.html)
- [contenu du répertoire OEIS](https://github.com/m-f-h/OEIS/) 
- [link to this page on github.io](https://m-f-h.github.io/OEIS/) [for easy access when viewing this in the repo]

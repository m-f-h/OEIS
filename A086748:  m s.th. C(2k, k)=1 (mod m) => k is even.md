# A086748: Odd numbers m such that when C(2k, k) == 1 (mod m) then k is necessarily even.

Robert Israel & MaxAl: Odd is important: all even numbers "voidly" satisfy the definition
  because C(2k,k) is always even, thus never ==1 (mod even m), 
  so for even m, any k such that ==1 (mod m) [which never happens], is always even.

COMMENT: If m is a term, then m*t is also a term for odd numbers t.

**Theorem 1:** if C(2k, k) == 1 (mod 3) then k is necessarily even. If C(2k, k) == 2 (mod 3) then k is necessarily odd.

**Proof:** for k < 6 it is correct. We have C(6r, 3r) == C(2r, r) (mod 3) and C(6r+4, 3r+2) == C(2r, r)*C(4, 2) == 0 (mod 3). 
  Suppose k is the least value such that theorem 1 is incorrect, then k must be of the form 3r+1. 
  But C(6r+2, 3r+1) == C(2r, r)*C(2, 1) (mod 3), which means that r is a smaller counterexample, a contradiction!

===> therefore all multiples of 3 are in the sequence

**Theorem 2:** if C(2k, k) == 1 or 4 (mod 5) then k is necessarily even. If C(2k, k) == 2 or 3 (mod 5) then k is necessarily odd.

Note that C(10r, 5r) == C(2r, r) (mod 5), C(10r+2, 5r+1) == C(2r, r)*C(2, 1) (mod 5), C(10r+4, 5r+2) == C(2r, r)*C(4, 2) (mod 5),
    C(10r+6, 5r+3) == C(2r, r)*C(6, 3) (mod 5) and C(10r+8, 5r+4) == C(2r, r)*C(8, 4) (mod 5). The proof is similar to that of theorem 1. (End)

===> therefore all multiples of 5 are in the sequence

Up to m < 1000, all odd m are either of the form 3*(2t-1) or 5*(2t-1) (as proved by _Jinyuan Wang_) and in the sequence,
or not in the sequence because an odd k <= 7412629 exists such that C(2k, k) == 1 (mod m). - _Giovanni Resta_, Apr 05 2020

## Is this A005408 \ A007775 ? - Antti Karttunen, Jul 11 2024

A005408 = the odd numbers 

A007775		Numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5.

= 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 89, 91, 97, 
  101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 119, 121, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 143, 149, 151, 157, 161, 163, 167, 169, 173, 179, 181, 187, 191, 193, 197, 199, 203, 209

Clearly, all numbers in O35 := A005408 \ A007775, i.e., odd numbers divisible by either 3 or 5, are in A086748.

Q: Do we also have :  ( x in A086748  =>  x in O35 ) ?

Counter-Example would be:  x in A086748  but  x not in O35, i.e., x not divisible by 3 or 5

EXAMPLE:
* m = 7 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 7) is solvable by the odd k=17.
* m = 11 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 11) is solvable by the odd k=13.
* m = 13 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 13) is solvable by the odd k=2383. 
* m = 23 is not a term because C(2k,k) = 1 (mod 23) is solvable by the odd k=3391. - _R. J. Mathar_, Jul 11 2024

## ==> we need a function that efficiently computes C(2k,k) mod m.

R.J.Mathar gives a "filter" in a SeqFan post:
Instead of (mod m), compute it (mod p) for the smallest prime divisor of m. (Necessary condition.)
(Several simplifications and improvements of the Maple code:)

LucasT(n,k,p)={ if(n>=k, my(kp = digits(k,p), np = digits(n,p)[-#kp..-1]);
                prod(i=1, #kp, binomial(np[i], kp[i]), Mod(1,p)))}

/* note : using the largest instead of smallest prime factor makes it ~ 3x faster */

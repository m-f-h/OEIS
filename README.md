# OEIS
code and more for OEIS sequences: [see the Wiki for more!](https://github.com/m-f-h/OEIS/wiki)

### Brief history:
In late 2025 we activated github.io pages for this repo, in particular to be able to visit .html pages with JavaScipt for "interactive illustrations", such as [A000124-interactive.html](https://m-f-h.github.io//OEIS/A000124-interactive.html).

In early 2026, we started [the Wiki](https://github.com/m-f-h/OEIS/wiki) and will now move most content to there for easier editing and better readability.

We'll keep only the .html (and .js, .css, ...) files here so they can be accessed from everywhere as github.io pages.
